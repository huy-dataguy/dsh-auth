# @deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-auth

> Subscription OAuth sign-in for [dsh-TUI](https://github.com/ccch1mneyyy/dsh-TUI) and
> [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness)

Use your **ChatGPT (Plus/Pro)**, **Claude (Pro/Max)** and **SuperGrok / X Premium**
subscriptions as model providers — sign in with the official account, no API
keys, and **no dsh source patch**. This plugin is developed alongside (and
bundled into) [dsh-TUI](https://github.com/ccch1mneyyy/dsh-TUI), the
Claude Code style terminal front door for DeepSeek Harness; it also installs
standalone into any dsh profile.

```
dsh-tui → /provider → 订阅账号登录（OAuth）→ sign in   ← the TUI integration
          /auth login openai-codex                     ← the plugin command
          /model → OpenAI Codex → gpt-5.6-sol          ← routes & models
```

**Status: experimental (M1).** The OAuth flows themselves are
[pi-ai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@earendil-works/pi-ai)'s shipped
implementations (device-code and loopback callback included); this plugin
adds the hosting: credential storage, automatic token refresh, adapter
registration, and a login surface over the `userQuestions` seam that works in
the TUI, the web client, and refuses cleanly on headless hosts.

## Install

**With dsh-TUI** — nothing to do: dsh-auth ships inside the dsh-tui package
(bundled dependency). Update dsh-tui and the `/provider` wizard gains its
subscription sign-in branch automatically.

**Standalone, into any dsh profile:**

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <name> add @deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-auth
```

Then restart the host; `/` lists `auth`, and every model picker gains the
signed-in providers' catalogs (credential-gated — see below).

## What it does

- Mounts the pi-ai catalog providers that ship OAuth flows as `llm` registry
  routes: `openai-codex`, `anthropic`, `xai`. **Models appear in a picker
  only after that provider is signed in** (credential-gated listing) — sign
  in and the catalog appears, sign out and it disappears; model ids already
  saved in sessions stay resolvable either way.
- Loads those Provider objects from the exact pi-ai dependency owned by the
  installed `dsh-llm-pi-ai`. rc and alpha hosts therefore keep their supported
  pi-ai versions without passing Provider objects across package instances.
- `/auth login [provider]` runs the provider's OAuth flow interactively. The
  waiting panel behaves the way pi's host does: the authorization URL is
  **opened in your browser automatically** (never hand-copied — the URL is
  hundreds of characters and wrap artifacts corrupt its `redirect_uri`),
  and the panel offers *Copy authorization link* / *Open browser again* /
  *Cancel sign-in*. Device-code flows open the verification page and make
  the short code the copy target. OpenAI Codex also offers a device-code
  login method — the most robust path on headless or locked-down machines
  (no localhost:1455 callback needed).
- Stored access tokens refresh automatically before each request, serialized
  per provider under the credential store's lock — concurrent requests never
  double-refresh a rotated token.
- `/auth status` / `/auth logout <provider>`; the `ctx.dshAuth` service
  exposes the same api for UIs (the dsh-tui `/provider` wizard and `/login`
  ride it).

## Usage

```
/auth                          # status: which providers are signed in
/auth login                    # pick a provider interactively
/auth login openai-codex       # ChatGPT (Plus/Pro)
/auth login anthropic          # Claude (Pro/Max)
/auth login xai                # SuperGrok / X Premium
/auth logout anthropic
```

Model requests against a provider you have not signed in to fail loudly with
the `/auth login <provider>` hint — never silently.

## Configuration

```yaml
- id: dsh-auth
  name: '@deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-auth'
  config:
    providers: [openai-codex, anthropic, xai]   # any non-empty subset
    # credentialsFile: /secure/path/credentials.json
```

- `credentialsFile` defaults to `$DSH_HOME/dsh-auth/credentials.json`
  (`~/.dsh/dsh-auth/credentials.json`), overridable with the
  `DSH_AUTH_CREDENTIALS` environment variable. The directory is created
  `0700`, the file `0600` (best-effort on Windows), and every write is
  atomic (temp file + rename).
- A route another adapter family already owns — an `llm-pi-ai` settings
  profile naming the same provider — is refused by the registry; the plugin
  logs the refusal and mounts the remaining routes. Keep one provider on one
  adapter.

## Security notes

- The credential file holds **long-lived refresh tokens**. It is never
  logged, never echoed through status surfaces (`/auth status` shows expiry
  metadata only), and a corrupt file fails loudly instead of being
  overwritten.
- Secret prompts warn that terminal input is not masked on this surface.
- Login refuses to run where no interactive surface is registered (no
  browser/GUI assumptions — remote and headless hosts get a clear error,
  per the ecosystem spec's remote-determinism rule, TUI-RUN-001).
- Subscription authentication and API-key access are different products:
  this plugin uses each provider's subscription backend only (ChatGPT Codex
  backend for OpenAI, Claude Pro/Max for Anthropic) and does not turn a
  subscription into a general-purpose API credential.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm verify     # build + headless smoke (credential store, refresh
                # serialization, prompt bridging, gating, service api)
```

The smoke suite runs without cordis or a harness: the pure modules are
exercised directly. Real end-to-end login needs an interactive host
(dsh-tui) and is verified manually per release. The plugin is developed in
the [dsh-TUI repository](https://github.com/ccch1mneyyy/dsh-TUI) as the
`dsh-auth/` submodule and mirrors to this repository.

## Roadmap

- **M2** *(landed)* — dsh-tui integration: `/provider` OAuth branch, `/login`
  account section, two-level `/model` picker with a pinned recently-used
  group.
- **M3** — `dsh-ecosystem-spec` conformance (manifest validation, admission
  fixtures) plus the remaining pi-ai OAuth providers (GitHub Copilot,
  OpenRouter, Kimi); community list entry.
- **M4** — Gemini: a custom Google device-code flow (pi-ai ships none; this
  is the one wheel this project plans to build itself).
